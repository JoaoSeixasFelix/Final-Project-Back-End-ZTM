# Final-Project-Back-End-ZTM

The objective of the project was to create all the parts of the project, in order to build a real experience of how to integrate both parts.

The Back-End was created and developed in Node, using the Express framework.

It was used from nodemon dependency, for automatic server update.

Bcrypt was used to hash and encrypt data such as email and password.

knex was used to make the connection between the database and the developed REST API.
